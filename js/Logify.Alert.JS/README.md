```

#### userId

### Methods for automatic reporting

Logify Alert allows you to automatically listen to uncaught exceptions and rejections, and deliver crash reports. For this purpose, use the methods below.

#### startHandling()

Commands Logify Alert to start listening to uncaught exceptions and rejections and send reports for all processed exceptions. 

```javascript
client.startHandling();
```

#### stopHandling()

Commands Logify Alert to stop listening to uncaught exceptions and rejections. 

```javascript
client.stopHandling();
```

### Methods for manual reporting

Alternatively, Logify Alert allows you to catch required exceptions manually, generate reports based on caught exceptions and send these reports only. For this purpose, use the methods below.

#### sendException(errorMsg, url, lineNumber, column, errorObj)

Sends information about the caught exception to the Logify Alert server.

```javascript
client.sendException(errorMsg, url, lineNumber, column, errorObj);
```

#### sendRejection(reason, promise)

Sends information about the caught rejection to the Logify Alert server.

```javascript
client.sendRejection(reason, promise);
```

### Callbacks

#### afterReportException(error)

Specifies a delegate to be called after sending exceptions and rejections to the Logify Alert server.

The *error* parameter holds an error text that indicates the report sending result. The *undefined* value specifies that the crash report has been successfully sent. The "*The report was not sent*" value specifies that the crash report has not been sent.

```javascript
client.afterReportException = function (error) {
        if (error == undefined) {
            // The report has been successfully sent
        }
        
        if (error == "The report was not sent") {
            // The report has not been sent
        }
}
```

#### beforeReportException(customData)

Specifies a delegate to be called before sending exceptions and rejections to the Logify Alert server.

The *customData* parameter holds custom data sent along with an exception or a rejection. The default value is *undefined*. If you change a parameter value within a callback, a new value will be stored and passed to a callback the next time you call it in your application.

```javascript
client.beforeReportException = function (customData) {
        if (customData == undefined) {
            customData = {};
        }
        customData["test key"] = "test value";
        return customData;
}
```
